# scull_driver #

My implementation of the scull driver from Linux Device Drivers (Third Edition) by Corbett, Rubini, and Kroah-Hartman. Basically this is a 'practice' repo, as I'm going through the book to sharpen up my device driver skills.

The book itself can be downloaded under the Creative Commons license at https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/.

The code in this repo is my implementation/interpretation of the scull driver, and isn't intended as an exact copy of the example code provided by the authors. The authors example code can be found at https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9780596005900/

My intent at the moment is to use a single repo and add to it as the driver becomes more complex, but I'll adjust the layout if needed.
