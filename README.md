# scull_driver #

My implementation of the scull driver from Linux Device Drivers (Third Edition) by Corbett, Rubini, and Kroah-Hartman. Basically this is a 'practice' repo, as I'm going through the book to sharpen up my device driver skills.

My intent at the moment, is to use a single repo and add to it as the driver becomes more complex, but I'll adjust the layout if needed.

The book itself can be downloaded under the Creative Commons license at https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/.

This project will include code from the examples provided with the book, which can be be found at: https://resources.oreilly.com/examples/9780596005900/
