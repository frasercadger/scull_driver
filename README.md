# scull_driver

My implementation of the scull driver from Linux Device Drivers (Third Edition) by Corbett, Rubini, and Kroah-Hartman. Basically this is a 'practice' repo, as I'm going through the book to sharpen up my device driver skills.

My intent at the moment, is to use a single repo and add to it as the driver becomes more complex, but I'll adjust the layout if needed.
